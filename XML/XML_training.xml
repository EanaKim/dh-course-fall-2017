            <div type="edition"><ab>In <date>the mid-1960s</date>, <persName role="author">Marshall McLuhan</persName> prophesied
                that electronic media were creating an increasingly interconnected
                global village. Such pronouncements popularized the
                idea that the era of machine-age technology was drawing to a
                close, ushering in a new era of information technology. Sensing
                this shift, Pontus Hultén organized a simultaneously nostalgic
                and futuristic exhibition on art and mechanical
                technology at <orgName>the Museum of Modern Art</orgName> in <placeName>New York</placeName>
                (MOMA) in <date>1968</date>. The Machine: As Seen at the End of the Mechanical
                Age included work ranging from Leonardo da Vinci’s
                16th-century drawings of ying machines to contemporary
                artist-engineer collaborations selected through a competition
                organized by Experiments in Art and Technology, Inc. (E.A.T.).</ab>
